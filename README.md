## About Husky

In our project we use Husky and pre-commit hook. It means that when you try to commit changes the following scripts will be executed automatically:

```shell
npm run lint:fix
npm run prettier
npm run stylelint:fix
```

and if any mistakes are detected after executing these scripts, you'll have to fix them manually before you can commit.

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for testing

You can run existing tests or create custom tests and execute it by running the following command

```shell
npm run test
```
